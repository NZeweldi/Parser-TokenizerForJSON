# Parser-TokenizerForJSON
I designed the algorithms in the parser.cpp and tokenizer.cpp files based on the project's design and elements.
Throughing testing I figured out how to have both the map correctly ordered and the tokenizer itself from 
creating mistakes based on how the contents are organized in the JSON file. Error messages and
exit codes are included which will prevent a file that includes incorrect characters, improper
allignment or missing strings/chars, and many more errors from processing without being recognized.
